# BSC-quality-control

## AI-powered smart manufacturing of carbon-negative building materials

Biopolymer-bound soil composite (BSC) is a novel technology that uses nature-based polymers to form carbon-negative building materials that are as strong as concrete. 
We developed a non-destructive vibration-based system that assesses initial material quality, before hardening occurs.


The system uses machine learning-based analysis of the time series data and allows for 
1. defect detection,
2. defect classification, and
3. strength monitoring

during the manufacturing process.

### Content of this repo

This repo holds the source code to reprocude the experimental results for a research paper, i.e. the source code is not structured in the form of an API but rather serves the purpose for scientists and reviewers to be able to evaluate and reproduce results.
**We highly recommend to refer to the paper before using this repo.**


The paper shows two types of machine learning models which we denote by **mini-ft** and **mega-ft**. These models, alongside the input data, can be found in this repo's folders.
